        <p class="para">I like Cricket because I feel happy to play and enjoy it very much.My friends and I play together as a team. I like batting I play very good and my friends too.I like bowling too I take many wickets and everyone else too.I do very good feilding and have taken many good catches and runouts. This game includes 22 playes in total 11 players in each team.There is a toss the team that wins can choose that they want first batting or bowling.
        The main aim of the first batting team is to score as many runs as possible in paticular overs and the first bowling team needs to take as many wickets and give less runs.Then the second batting team has to make 1 more run than the other team has made in paticular overs and the bowling team has to make sure that they do not make more runs than they have made. There is a big contribution in feilding too becaus they have to take catches and make sure that they do not drop catches.</p>
